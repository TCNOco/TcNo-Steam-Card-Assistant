# TcNo-Steam-Card-Assistant 
A simple Open-source extension for Steam Badge crafting and managing.

>### What exactly does the plugin do?
* Forces HTTPS, because it's more secure and not always enforced by Steam on the SteamCommunity.com pages and it is nessecary for the extension to use AJAX, for crafting badges.
* Allows users to craft multiple badges from the Steam Badge page, instead of crafting one, waiting for the refresh and so on. It shortens the unnessecarily long process to just a simple click and it's done instantly.
* Purchase badge sets in groups of 5, making mass crafting even easier.
* (NEW 2020) Added button to craft 1 of each available. Mass crafting is now even easier!
* (NEW 2020) Round up prices to make sure you don't MultiBuy, and  miss the cheapest if the price changes.
* Allows users to craft multiple badges from the Steam Badge List page, so that they don't have to go into specific pages and craft them from there, they can craft multiple badges form many different games more quickly than doing it from their respective pages.

>### Why?
This plugin was created because crafting badges on Steam to level up your account can take a really long time, even if you know how to do it via the Chrome or Firefox console, using Javascript. AFAIK there are no plugins that allow you to craft multiple Steam Badges at once, and especially none that let you craft them from the Steam Badge list page.
I used to find the command for each game so I could craft 5 badges at once. Digging through the code was faster than crafting 5 badges individually on slow internet. This Add-on/Extension fixes the need to wait for each individual badge to craft, and it just crafts them instantly when you click the button.
I find this plugin very useful, and I'm quite sure that other people will feel the same.
